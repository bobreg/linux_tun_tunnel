This simple program allows to establish a tunnel connection between two computers which are connected to internet. It implements client - server connection through network. For a tunnel the program creates a virtual tun interface and assigns an Ip address. After that the program reads IP frames from a tun device and sends them to a remote computer via an eth interface. 
A real connection between two computers is created with UDP sockets. The program binds a certain UDP ports for sending and receiving UDP datagrams. If the program works as a client, then it sends alive packages every 10 seconds and waits responds from a remote server program in order to support connection. The client might work behind NAT. If the program works as a server, 
then it waits incomings alive packages and answer with responds alive package for supporting the connection. If there is a connection between two copies of the program, it is possible to pass IP frames from TUN devices through the real connection via UPD frames.
